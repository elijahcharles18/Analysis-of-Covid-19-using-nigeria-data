# COVID-19 Data Analysis in Nigeria

## Overview
COVID-19 in Nigeria began with the first confirmed case on **February 27, 2020**. In response, the government implemented travel restrictions, lockdowns, and social distancing measures. By **mid-2023**, Nigeria had reported over **250,000 confirmed cases** and around **3,000 deaths**.

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to **investigate the differences in the total deaths due to COVID-19 across six regions in Nigeria**. The study uses statistical methods to determine whether the death rates vary significantly between regions and identifies regions with higher death tolls.

## Summary
An **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** test was conducted to determine if there are significant differences in total COVID-19 deaths across different regions. The results show significant differences between several regions. Further **Tukey's Honest Significant Differences (HSD)** test was performed to pinpoint which specific regions differ from one another in terms of COVID-19 death rates.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset, `covid_df`, contains records of **total deaths attributed to COVID-19** across various regions of Nigeria. 

### 2. Data Preparation
The data was inspected for completeness and consistency. The primary variables of interest were:
- `total_death` (response variable)
- `region` (predictor variable)

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **ANOVA** was used to assess whether there are statistically significant differences in the total death rates across regions.
- After finding significant results from the ANOVA, **Tukeyâ€™s HSD Post Hoc** analysis was conducted to identify which specific regions have significantly different death rates.

## ANOVA Results
The ANOVA table below presents the results of testing whether the total number of deaths significantly differs across the regions.

| **Source**     | **df** | **Sum Sq** | **Mean Sq** | **F Value** | **Pr(>F)** |
|----------------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Region         | 5      | 1,786,769  | 357,354     | 91.22       | < 2e-16    |
| Residual       | 4094   | 16,038,541 | 3,918       |             |            |

- **F(5, 4094) = 91.22**, with a **p-value** of **< 2e-16**, which indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, there are significant differences in the total deaths across the regions.

## Visual Presentation of Results

### Post Hoc Analysis Results

The Tukey HSD test results indicate which pairs of regions have statistically significant differences in COVID-19 death rates. Below are the pairwise comparisons:

## Conclusion
The **ANOVA** and **Tukey's HSD Post Hoc analysis** results show significant differences in the mean COVID-19 death rates across the six regions in Nigeria. Specifically:
- The **South West** and **South South** regions have significantly higher death rates compared to other regions.
- The findings highlight the need for **targeted policy interventions** and **strategic resource allocation** to address the high death rates in these regions.

The analysis provides important insights for public health officials to allocate resources more effectively in regions with the highest death tolls, aiming to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
